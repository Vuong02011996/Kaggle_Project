+ Model Release Date: April 18, 2024. 
+ To access Llama 3 on Kaggle, you need to first be granted access from Meta
+ Llama 3 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 8 billion to 70 billion parameters
+ Variation: 8b-chat-hf, Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters 
+ Open in Vertex AI: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/meta/model-garden/llama3
+ The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized **for dialogue use cases** and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks
+ Input: Models input text only.
+ Output: Models generate text and code only.
+ Model Architecture: uses an optimized transformer architecture
    + The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.
